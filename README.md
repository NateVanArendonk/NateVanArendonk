### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nate VanArendonk, a software engineer based in Bellingham, Washington.

## About Me

Iâ€™m a backend-leaning full-stack engineer, currently working on a product and analytics platform for Netsmart, a health-tech company. I bring a scientist's perspective to my work, drawing on my years of experience as a trained scientist in coastal geomorphology and numerical modeling to tackle complex technical challenges. When I'm not in front of my computer, you'll find me either mountain biking, skiing, or wing foiling.

## Projects

Checkout some of these projects I've spun up:

- [The Windline](https://thewindline.com/) - Wind forecasting app for the Salish Sea focused on wind sports and optimizing time on the water.
- [Sail Selector](https://www.sailselector.com/) - Web app to help wing foilers find the optimal range for winging given their weight and a gear size.
